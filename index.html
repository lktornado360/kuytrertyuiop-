It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and
counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged
as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by the
119
various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in
the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the
prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What kind of people would control this
world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made up for the most
part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity
experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These
people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of
the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world
of monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their
opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury,
hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing
and more intent on crushing opposition. This last difference was cardinal. By
comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient. The ruling groups were always infected to some extent
by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only
the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even
the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part
of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep
its citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however, made
it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the
process further. With the development of television, and the technical advance
which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same
instrument, private life came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizen
important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twentyfour hours a
day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all
other channels of communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only
complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion
on all subjects, now existed for the first time.
After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped
itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High group, unlike all
its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard
its position. It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy
is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are
possessed jointly. The so-called ’abolition of private property’ which took place
in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property
in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners
were a group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the
Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the Party
owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and disposes of the
products as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was able to step
into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was
represented as an act of collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the
capitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably
the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses, transport
— everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no
longer private property, it followed that they must be public property. Ingsoc,
which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its phraseology,
has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with the
result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been
made permanent.
120
But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this.
There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. Either
it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are
stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come
into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. These
causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some
degree. A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in
power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of
the ruling class itself.
After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact
unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic
changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. The second
danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never revolt of their own
accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so
long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never
even become aware that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic crises of
past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but
other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political
results, because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate. As
fcr the problem of overproduction, which has been latent in our society since
the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous
warfare (see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the
necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only
genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able, under-employed,
power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own
ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger
executive group that lies immediately below it. The consciousness of the masses
needs only to be influenced in a negative way.
Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,
the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes
Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every
achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom,
all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen Big Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a
voice on the telescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and
there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is
the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function
is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are
more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization. Below Big
Brother comes the Inner Party. its numbers limited to six millions, or something
less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party comes
the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State,
may be justly likened to the hands. Below that come the dumb masses whom
we habitually refer to as ’the proles’, numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the
population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for
the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror
to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.
In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The child
121
of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party. Admission to
either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor
is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one province
by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be
found in the highest ranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area
are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part of Oceania
do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled
from a distant capital. Oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person
whose whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief lingua franca
and Newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers
are not held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine.
It is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at
first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to- and-fro movement
between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the preindustrial age. Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount
of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded
from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made
harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed
to graduate into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might possibly
become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought Police
and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it
a matter of principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It
does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there
were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly
prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat.
In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a
great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of Socialist, who had been
trained to fight against something called ’class privilege’ assumed that what
is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of
an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary
aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such
as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of
years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the
persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead
upon the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate
its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but
with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, provided that the
hierarchical structure remains always the same.
All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize
our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent
the true nature of present-day society from being perceived. Physical rebellion,
or any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not possible. From the
proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from
generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and
dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping
that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous
if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more
highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the
level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold,
or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted
122
intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party member, on the
other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant
subject can be tolerated.
A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought
Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he
can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his relaxations,
his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression of his face when
he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements
of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour,
but any eccentricity, however small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to
be detected. He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. On the
other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated
code of behaviour. In Oceania there is no law. Thoughts and actions which,
when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless
purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as
punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the
wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the
future. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions, but the
right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never
plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions
inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak a goodthinker), he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is
the true belief or the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental
training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words
crimestop, blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to
think too deeply on any subject whatever.
A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from
enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign
enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before
the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare,
unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices
as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a
sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner
discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught
even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, crimestop. Crimestop means
the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any
dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing
to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they
are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought
which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means
protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy
in the full sense demands a control over one’s own mental processes as complete
as that of a contortionist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the
belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since
in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is
need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.
The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has
123
two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the
habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain
facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black
is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to
believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget
that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration
of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all
the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.
The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party
member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because
he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the past, just as
he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to
believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of
material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason
for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the
Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must
be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the
Party were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political
alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one’s mind, or even one’s policy,
is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it
may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus history
is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out
by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the
work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.
The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is
argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in
human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree
upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full
control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party
chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has
been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever
shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different
past can ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the
same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a
year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the
absolute can never have been different from what it is now. It will be seen that
the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. To make
sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely
a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to remember that events happened
in the desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one’s memories or to
tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done
so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique.
It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are
intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, ’reality
control’. In Newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises
much else as well.
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s
mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows
124
in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is
playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies
himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would
not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious,
or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink
lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use
conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget
any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary
again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny
the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality
which one denies — all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word
doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one
admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one
erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead
of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the Party has been
able — and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years —
to arrest the course of history.
All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust
themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became
liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and
once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the achievement of the Party to have
produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be
made permanent. If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to
dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief
in one’s own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.
It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those
who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating.
In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also
those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. In general, the greater the
understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. One
clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one
rises in the social scale. Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly
rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the
war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies
like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to
them. They are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will
be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same
manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured workers whom we call ’the
proles’ are only intermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary they
can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they
are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. It is in the
ranks of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm
is found. World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to
be impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites — knowledge with
ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism-is one of the chief distinguishing marks of
Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions even when
125
there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every
principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to
do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for the working class
unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which
was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason. It
systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a
name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names
of the four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in
their deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with
war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the
Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental,
nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in
doublethink. For it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be
retained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If
human equality is to be for ever averted — if the High, as we have called them,
are to keep their places permanently — then the prevailing mental condition
must be controlled insanity.
